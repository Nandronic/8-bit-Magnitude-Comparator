# 8-bit-Magnitude-Comparator
A compact, synthesizable Verilog design that compares two 8-bit numbers and asserts one of three outputs to indicate A > B, A &lt; B, or A == B. Includes a simple testbench, guidance for simulation (CLI + EDA Playground), and a summary of UVM verification and OpenROAD physical design results.
